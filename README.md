# Coding-Quiz-Challenge

Coding Quiz Challenge is a fun way to challenge your knowledge when it comes to Javascript. This application will time the user on the quickness they can get through the questions. If the user gets a question incorrect, the timer will deduct 15 seconds off of the timer.  Your score is determined by the amount of time left when all the questions are answered.  Good Luck!
